<h3>DEFCON 2014 Network Forensics Puzzle Contest: From Pyongyang with Love</h3>

<p> Thank you for getting that information to us. We can clearly see that the briber, Ill-song, is communicating with the official from Caracas to set up a non-cash bribe. We need more than that, however. We need an idea of what Ill-song is using to bribe the official. Look through this capture and see if you can find out what the non-cash bribe is. Please hurry, the voting is about to begin! <br> Use the <a href="./FearThePackets.pcap"> Round 3</a> packet capture in this folder</a> to learn more about the case and answer the following question:
 <br>
<br>What is the non-cash bribe?
