<h3>DEFCON 2014 Network Forensics Puzzle Contest: From Pyongyang with Love</h3>

<p>One of your colleagues was able to intercept messages between Ill-song and Ann Dercover, a professional chess boxer. The Chess Boxing World Title will be held in Pyongyang next year, and we know that this is only because of a bribe from a "Kim Ill-song". We now believe that this is an alias. Whoever it is has relations with Ann Dercover, and we believe that that Ill-song is using the Title to get her into North Korea. Since "Ill-song" is so determined to contact Ann, we've begun investigating her. So far we've just been tapping her phone and home network traffic. Based on their conversation, we believe that Mr. Ill-song (or whoever he is) will try to contact her in the near future and set up a time to meet. Look through this capture and let us know if you find out a meeting time. Remember, we need the date AND time. <br> Use the <a href="./RomanticDate.pcap"> Round 5</a> packet capture in this folder</a> to learn more about the case and answer the following question:
 <br>
<br>What is the month, date, and time of their meeting?
