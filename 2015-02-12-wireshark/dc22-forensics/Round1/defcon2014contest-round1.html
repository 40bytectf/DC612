<p> Thank you for accepting the case. Our Russian comrade has indicated that said documents released by Snowden may contain information about a bribery involving the 2015 Chess Boxing World Title. We've been monitoring Snowden's traffic, and need to know who all is involved. We suspect that there is a list of usernames, and we would like you to tell us who is the second name on the list. <br> Use the <a href="./DatSecrets.pcap"> Round 1</a> packet capture in this folder</a> to learn more about the case and answer the following question:
