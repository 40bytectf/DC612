<h3>DEFCON 2014 Network Forensics Puzzle Contest: From Pyongyang with Love</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, you were not quick enough and Pyongyang has been chosen for the Chess Boxing World Title. Furthermore, the chess set you uncovered was one of a very limited set and is incredibly expensive. To be frank, we're not sure how Kim Ill-song has the resources to obtain it. We've begun looking into Ill-song, but we can't seem to find anything on the guy. Rumor has it that he's trying to communicate with a particular individual, but we need to find out who and why. This capture shows him talking with someone else, but we're not sure how or what's being said. We need information on Ill-song before we can move on to his partner. Can you get us the device name of Ill-song's computer? <br> Use the <a href="./TwueLub.pcap"> Round 4</a> packet capture in this folder</a> to learn more about the case and answer the following question:
 <br>
<br>What is the device name of Ill-song's computer?
