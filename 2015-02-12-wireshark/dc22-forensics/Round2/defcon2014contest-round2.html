<h3>DEFCON 2014 Network Forensics Puzzle Contest: From Pyongyang with Love</h3>

<p> We see that North Korea is in the running for hosting next year's title fight. Kim Ill-song might be exactly who we are looking for. We've taken a capture of Mr. Kim Ill-song's network traffic, and we see that he's been communicating with many people from different countries. We suspect that he is among those making bribes, but we need proof. Cash is relatively easy to move, but we've got word that one of the bribes was something else. Voting for the hosting city begins soon. <br> Use the <a href="./FIFA22.pcap"> Round 2</a> packet capture in this folder</a> to learn more about the case and answer the following question:
 <br>
<br>What city's official is accepting a non-cash bribe?
